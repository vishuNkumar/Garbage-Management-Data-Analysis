# Garbage-Management-Data-Analysis
## 1. About Garbage Disposal Management (GDM)
- Garbage Disposal Management, also referred to as Waste Management, involves handling waste from its inception to its final disposal. The primary aim is to mitigate the negative environmental and health impacts of waste.
- The survey was conducted among 500 households to understand their waste disposal practices and satisfaction with the current waste management system.
## 2. Survey Overview
- Most households dispose of waste either daily or every two to three days.
- Common disposal methods include door-to-door collection or dustbin disposal.
- Garbage segregation is low, with only a few households separating waste into wet and dry categories.
- The overall satisfaction with waste disposal services is low, with several respondents expressing dissatisfaction.
- Many participants show interest in waste disposal training, indicating an opportunity for educational initiatives.
## 3. Data Collection Method
- The data has collect by largely survey-based, collecting information on various aspects of household waste management practices.
  ### (a) Survey Questionnaires:
  The primary method of data collection appears to be surveys administered to 500 households. The survey likely included structured questions related to household waste disposal habits, frequency, segregation, satisfaction with government services, and willingness to attend training on waste management. In the format of MCQ/MSQs type.
  ### (b) Sampling Method:
  The survey was conducted on a sample of 500 households. This sample might have been selected through **Random Sampling** to ensure diversity and representativeness of different income groups, geographic areas, and household sizes.
The sample size of 500 households seems reasonable for drawing conclusions about general waste disposal practices within a community, neighborhood, or city.
  ### (c) Satisfaction and Opinion Polling:
  Satisfaction with the government’s waste removal services and awareness of penalties was also gauged through opinion-based questions, using **Likert scales** or simple “Yes/No” questions.
## 4. Survey Findings
After collection the data firstly we clean the data using **Excel** and then analyse the data to take decision for healthy environment. Here is the screenshot of cleaned data

then we create the pivot table to analyze data, answer questions, and make decisions.
- *Pivot Table* : A pivot table is a tool that summarizes large amounts of data in an interactive way. It's used to analyze data, answer questions, and make decisions.
  - How can we use Pivot Table ?
    - Rearrange data: Move rows and columns around to compare data in different ways.
    - Categorize data: Group measures into categories that appear as rows or columns in the pivot table.
    - Filter data: Choose which data to show in the pivot table.
    - Summarize data: Use statistics like count, average, sum, or min to summarize the values in a measure.
    - Refresh data: When the original data is updated, the pivot table can be refreshed to reflect the new information.
